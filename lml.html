                <p>This is an attempt to create the most 
                    comprehensive overview and refutation of anti-lolicon/shotacon 
                    beliefs in one writeup/essay. It will address various secondary 
                    arguments used by people in groups with these beliefs first, 
                    then confront in detail what I believe to be their primary argument 
                    and the core of their opposition to the fetish.                     
                    </p>
                <p>I am primarily focusing on Internet keyboard 
                    warriors who specifically target this type of fetish content here, 
                    rather than, for example, religious conservatives and 
                    pseudo-feminists who oppose all pornography entirely, 
                    as their issues are far more broad than simply a desire to 
                    stamp out one niche fetish. I am also primarily focusing on the 
                    arguments made by self identified leftists, liberals, 
                    and progressives, since right-wing opposition to this stuff tends 
                    to come in the form of the aforementioned religious conservatism 
                    or general anti-porn stances, whereas there is an abundance of 
                    self-identified leftists, progressives, and liberals who specifically 
                    and deliberately oppose loli/shota.</p>
                <p>In addition, this writeup will include a 
                    refutation of similar arguments made pertaining to the morality of 
                    character age in regards to sexualization. This is, for the most, 
                    part a separate issue entirely from loli, but many of the people who 
                    oppose it also oppose sexualizing so-called “underage” characters, and 
                    will even go as far as using arguments against one in order to argue 
                    against the other, despite the complete inapplicability of those 
                    arguments to the topic they’re using them against (and some cases, 
                    their arguments debunking their own points for them — but more on that 
                    when we get to it).</p>

            <div class="sectiontitle">SECTION 1: THE DEFINITION OF LOLICON/SHOTACON</div>
            <div class="sectionbody">
                <p>It is worth clarifying that “lolicon” and 
                    “shotacon” (derived from “lolita complex” and “shotaro complex” 
                    respectively — this will be addressed later)
                    refer both to the genres of art and porn centered around these 
                    characters, as well as to people who are fans of these characters. 
                    "Loli” and “shota”, on the other hand, refer to the characters.                   
                    
                </p>
                <p> The terms “lolicon” and “shotacon” are
                     occasionally used to refer to real pedophiles or child 
                     molesters in Japan, but they are not the primary terms 
                     for such offenders. The usage is similar to the word 
                     “sadist” in English — a real psychotic murderer who 
                     takes joy in tormenting his victims would be correctly called a 
                     “sadist”, but the term “sadist” can often refer to people who take 
                     part in BDSM and enjoy inflicting pain on people as part of a 
                     harmless, consensual fantasy. The use of the term “sadist” to refer
                     to a murderous psychopath does not make BDSM dominants murderous 
                     psychopaths, just as the use of the terms “lolicon” and “shotacon” 
                     for pedophiles and child molesters does not make fans of 
                     loli/shota hentai pedophiles or child molesters. </p>
                <p>Numerous Japanese manga creators have 
                    referred to themselves as lolicons and shotacons when 
                    alluding to their enjoyment of the fantasy characters, 
                    and this is not viewed as alluding to real pedophilia. 
                    (MIGHT NEED A SOURCE FOR THIS ONE, I KNOW MIURA HAS BUT I 
                    NEED A FEW MORE)</p>
                <p class="citation">Japanese Perspective from yuuki Aoi on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL0Tim6ZRTI">youtube</a></p>
                <p>Loli characters are defined purely by their 
                    appearance, as it is a visual aesthetic and body type. 
                    They are not defined by character age, or by behavior.
                     A loli character can have any personality that a writer 
                     or artist wants them to, childish, mature, inhuman or anywhere 
                     in between. A character is or is not a loli regardless of 
                     in-universe age as long as they visually fit the archetype. 
                     A character cannot be loli based on age if they do not fit the 
                     visual appearance. This definition is identical for shota 
                     characters, but shota characters are obviously male as opposed to 
                     female.</p>
                <p>One of the most common claims by is that 
                    lolicon/shotacon is wrong because it’s against the law, 
                    or legally considered child porn. </p>
                <p>This is bundled with both: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The assumption that the current law is inherently just and we should base our moral values on it, and </li>
                    <li>The assumption that any type of pornography or sexual activity which is criminalized is also wrong.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Even if lolicon were illegal, why would that matter morally speaking? 
                    Most people will agree that morality shouldn’t simply be 
                    based on what is and isn’t legal according to one government or 
                    another. Possessing or selling marijuana is illegal in a majority 
                    of nations, does this make it immoral or unethical to do? If an 
                    authoritarian government decides to make protesting its actions 
                    illegal, is it wrong to oppose this government? Why should we 
                    base our personal morality on what a government decides should or 
                    shouldn’t be permitted in its borders? Not to mention — 
                    which nation has moral authority over others? If one country rules 
                    lolicon is legal and not CSEM and the other rules that it’s illegal 
                    and is CSEM, which is right?</p>
                <p>Most people will agree that the law should reflect their 
                    personal morality, not the other way around, 
                    but anti-loli crusaders will still use the claim that lolicon is 
                    illegal in one country or another as a reason for it being wrong or 
                    equivalent to pedophilia, a mentality which reflects an underlying 
                    authoritarian mindset. It is also a conflation of what currently is 
                    and what ought to be — presuming that the law as it stands is some 
                    sort of objective moral code by virtue of it being the law. 
                    “Lolicon should be illegal because it is illegal”.</p>
                <p>
                    But let’s give this insane argument the benefit of the doubt and presume that lolicon is immoral and equivalent to pedophilia if it’s illegal, and by extension, that any other type of pornography or sexual activity the government outlaws is also immoral. Is it?
                </p>
                <p>It turns out that this claim is not even correct most of the time. Most nations either do not have any laws that pertain to lolicon or any other form of fiction whatsoever, have vague laws which could be applied to it but do not explicitly outlaw it, or have laws which seem like they could apply to it but have been dismissed in court when used or never used against it. A number nations — North and South Korea, India, Cuba, China, most of the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia, as well as a lot of Eastern Europe — outlaw all porn entirely, so they are irrelevant to this discussion.</p>
                <p>Only three countries, all part of the British Commonwealth, have meaningfully implemented laws against lolicon and other specific varieties of fetish porn — Canada, the UK, and Australia. All three of these countries criminalize numerous other varieties of porn and consensual sex acts in addition to lolicon. None of these countries actively attempt to arrest people for creating, purchasing, or downloading lolicon content, block imports of lolicon media, or shut down websites hosting lolicon like they do for actual CSEM.</p>

                    Initially, I was going to address this argument as one of the
                     secondary arguments against loli/shota, but my refutation of 
                     it ended up becoming so lengthy that I spun it off into 
                     its own section of this essay.
