                <p class="normalText">This is an attempt to create the most 
                    comprehensive overview and refutation of anti-lolicon/shotacon 
                    beliefs in one writeup/essay. It will address various secondary 
                    arguments used by people in groups with these beliefs first, 
                    then confront in detail what I believe to be their primary argument 
                    and the core of their opposition to the fetish.                     
                    </p>
                <p class="normaltext">I am primarily focusing on Internet keyboard 
                    warriors who specifically target this type of fetish content here, 
                    rather than, for example, religious conservatives and 
                    pseudo-feminists who oppose all pornography entirely, 
                    as their issues are far more broad than simply a desire to 
                    stamp out one niche fetish. I am also primarily focusing on the 
                    arguments made by self identified leftists, liberals, 
                    and progressives, since right-wing opposition to this stuff tends 
                    to come in the form of the aforementioned religious conservatism 
                    or general anti-porn stances, whereas there is an abundance of 
                    self-identified leftists, progressives, and liberals who specifically 
                    and deliberately oppose loli/shota.</p>
                <p class="normalText">In addition, this writeup will include a 
                    refutation of similar arguments made pertaining to the morality of 
                    character age in regards to sexualization. This is, for the most, 
                    part a separate issue entirely from loli, but many of the people who 
                    oppose it also oppose sexualizing so-called “underage” characters, and 
                    will even go as far as using arguments against one in order to argue 
                    against the other, despite the complete inapplicability of those 
                    arguments to the topic they’re using them against (and some cases, 
                    their arguments debunking their own points for them — but more on that 
                    when we get to it).</p>

            <div class="sectiontitle">SECTION 1: THE DEFINITION OF LOLICON/SHOTACON</div>
            <div class="sectionbody">
                <p class="normalText">It is worth clarifying that “lolicon” and 
                    “shotacon” (derived from “lolita complex” and “shotaro complex” 
                    respectively — this will be addressed later)
                    refer both to the genres of art and porn centered around these 
                    characters, as well as to people who are fans of these characters. 
                    "Loli” and “shota”, on the other hand, refer to the characters.                   
                    
                </p>
                <p class="normaltext"> The terms “lolicon” and “shotacon” are
                     occasionally used to refer to real pedophiles or child 
                     molesters in Japan, but they are not the primary terms 
                     for such offenders. The usage is similar to the word 
                     “sadist” in English — a real psychotic murderer who 
                     takes joy in tormenting his victims would be correctly called a 
                     “sadist”, but the term “sadist” can often refer to people who take 
                     part in BDSM and enjoy inflicting pain on people as part of a 
                     harmless, consensual fantasy. The use of the term “sadist” to refer
                     to a murderous psychopath does not make BDSM dominants murderous 
                     psychopaths, just as the use of the terms “lolicon” and “shotacon” 
                     for pedophiles and child molesters does not make fans of 
                     loli/shota hentai pedophiles or child molesters. </p>
                <p class="normaltext">Numerous Japanese manga creators have 
                    referred to themselves as lolicons and shotacons when 
                    alluding to their enjoyment of the fantasy characters, 
                    and this is not viewed as alluding to real pedophilia.

                    NEED A FEW MORE)</p>

                    Initially, I was going to address this argument as one of the
                     secondary arguments against loli/shota, but my refutation of 
                     it ended up becoming so lengthy that I spun it off into 
                     its own section of this essay.
