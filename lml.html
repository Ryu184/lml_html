                <p>This is an attempt to create the most 
                    comprehensive overview and refutation of anti-lolicon/shotacon 
                    beliefs in one writeup/essay. It will address various secondary 
                    arguments used by people in groups with these beliefs first, 
                    then confront in detail what I believe to be their primary argument 
                    and the core of their opposition to the fetish.                     
                    </p>
                <p>I am primarily focusing on Internet keyboard 
                    warriors who specifically target this type of fetish content here, 
                    rather than, for example, religious conservatives and 
                    pseudo-feminists who oppose all pornography entirely, 
                    as their issues are far more broad than simply a desire to 
                    stamp out one niche fetish. I am also primarily focusing on the 
                    arguments made by self identified leftists, liberals, 
                    and progressives, since right-wing opposition to this stuff tends 
                    to come in the form of the aforementioned religious conservatism 
                    or general anti-porn stances, whereas there is an abundance of 
                    self-identified leftists, progressives, and liberals who specifically 
                    and deliberately oppose loli/shota.</p>
                <p>In addition, this writeup will include a 
                    refutation of similar arguments made pertaining to the morality of 
                    character age in regards to sexualization. This is, for the most, 
                    part a separate issue entirely from loli, but many of the people who 
                    oppose it also oppose sexualizing so-called “underage” characters, and 
                    will even go as far as using arguments against one in order to argue 
                    against the other, despite the complete inapplicability of those 
                    arguments to the topic they’re using them against (and some cases, 
                    their arguments debunking their own points for them — but more on that 
                    when we get to it).</p>

            <div class="sectiontitle">SECTION 1: THE DEFINITION OF LOLICON/SHOTACON</div>
            <div class="sectionbody">
                <p>It is worth clarifying that “lolicon” and 
                    “shotacon” (derived from “lolita complex” and “shotaro complex” 
                    respectively — this will be addressed later)
                    refer both to the genres of art and porn centered around these 
                    characters, as well as to people who are fans of these characters. 
                    "Loli” and “shota”, on the other hand, refer to the characters.                   
                    
                </p>
                <p> The terms “lolicon” and “shotacon” are
                     occasionally used to refer to real pedophiles or child 
                     molesters in Japan, but they are not the primary terms 
                     for such offenders. The usage is similar to the word 
                     “sadist” in English — a real psychotic murderer who 
                     takes joy in tormenting his victims would be correctly called a 
                     “sadist”, but the term “sadist” can often refer to people who take 
                     part in BDSM and enjoy inflicting pain on people as part of a 
                     harmless, consensual fantasy. The use of the term “sadist” to refer
                     to a murderous psychopath does not make BDSM dominants murderous 
                     psychopaths, just as the use of the terms “lolicon” and “shotacon” 
                     for pedophiles and child molesters does not make fans of 
                     loli/shota hentai pedophiles or child molesters. </p>
                <p>Numerous Japanese manga creators have 
                    referred to themselves as lolicons and shotacons when 
                    alluding to their enjoyment of the fantasy characters, 
                    and this is not viewed as alluding to real pedophilia. 
                    (MIGHT NEED A SOURCE FOR THIS ONE, I KNOW MIURA HAS BUT I 
                    NEED A FEW MORE)</p>
                <p class="citation">Japanese Perspective from yuuki Aoi on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL0Tim6ZRTI">youtube</a></p>
                <p>Loli characters are defined purely by their 
                    appearance, as it is a visual aesthetic and body type. 
                    They are not defined by character age, or by behavior.
                     A loli character can have any personality that a writer 
                     or artist wants them to, childish, mature, inhuman or anywhere 
                     in between. A character is or is not a loli regardless of 
                     in-universe age as long as they visually fit the archetype. 
                     A character cannot be loli based on age if they do not fit the 
                     visual appearance. This definition is identical for shota 
                     characters, but shota characters are obviously male as opposed to 
                     female.</p>
                <p>This visual appearance is defined by childlike physical traits, in the same way that a furry character is defined by animal-like physical traits. This can vary widely due thanks to variations in art style, but generally, lolis and shotas need to be short, flat-chested, and have small, petite bodies. Characters who are literal in-universe children can be loli/shota, but not all are, and the term is never applied to realistic depictions of actual children within fictional works or by Japanese fans (though some western fans will occasionally throw the term around willy-nilly). It is important to remember that loli is about childlike traits, not the literal 1 to 1 representation of children as they exist in reality.</p>
                <p>Lolicon/shotacon as a fetish pertains exclusively to this visual archetype, not to character age at all. It can overlap with a fetish for childlike behavior (similar to the ABDL and DD-LG kinks), but that is not even remotely a part of it, rather a completely separate fetish.</p>
                <p>“Lolibaba” (literally “loli old lady”) is the proper name for the trope of loli characters who are hundreds or thousands of years old (typically also supernatural creatures like vampires, demons, witches, angels, or gods). Examples include Etna from Disgaea, Mina Tepes from Dance in the Vampire Bund, Rachel Alucard from BlazBlue, Shuten-Douji from Fate/Grand Order, and the various Manakete dragons from Fire Emblem. This popular trope is mocked constantly by anti-loli crusaders, and is often referred to as an “excuse”, “defense” or “loophole” for lolicon. However, that is a complete false assumption as to why the trope exists. Loli fans don’t need an “excuse” or “loophole” to enjoy loli — they know fiction is not reality, they don’t need to Google a canon age before they find a character attractive. Even if they were looking for a “loophole”, it wouldn’t be an adequate explanation for why lolibabas are specifically hundreds or thousands of years old as opposed to just normal adults (though normal adult loli characters do exist, they’re not part of the trope).</p>
                <p>The actual reason for the existence of the lolibaba trope is a contrast between a childlike appearance and an extremely old age. The age is extremely old as a form of exaggeration that draws attention to the contrast. This kind of contrast is very common in fiction, with one well-known example being the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog from Monty Python and the Holy Grail, a terrifying monster in the form of a small, cutesy white rabbit. The contrast wouldn’t work if it were, say, a normal-looking wolf — it has to specifically be the exact opposite of a horrific man-eating monster, much like the lolibaba has to be the exact opposite of a child.</p>
                <p>It’s worth noting that almost all lolibabas act extremely maturely, like an all-knowing and all-powerful fantasy overlord or a wise, grandmotherly figure. This is relevant as anti-loli crusaders will often claim that loli is defined by characters “acting like a child” or lolibaba characters “look and act like children” despite their age, when if they’d actually experienced any media with lolibabas in it, they’d understand that this could not be further from the truth.</p>
                <p class="emph">(Beside the point, but for some reason, the male equivalent of the lolibaba trope is exceedingly rare, with only a few characters like Xenosaga’s Wilhelm or Tsukihime’s Merem Solomon coming to mind. Western fans have coined “shotajiji”, or “shota old man”, as a term for this, mirroring lolibaba, but I have never seen that term used in any actual Japanese media or fandom)</p>

            <div class="sectiontitle">SECTION 2: LOLICON, SHOTACON AND THE LAW</div>
            <div class="sectionbody">
                <p>
                    Initially, I was going to address this argument as one of the
                     secondary arguments against loli/shota, but my refutation of 
                     it ended up becoming so lengthy that I spun it off into 
                     its own section of this essay.
                </p>
                <p>One of the most common claims by is that 
                    lolicon/shotacon is wrong because it’s against the law, 
                    or legally considered child porn. </p>
                <p>This is bundled with both: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The assumption that the current law is inherently just and we should base our moral values on it, and </li>
                    <li>The assumption that any type of pornography or sexual activity which is criminalized is also wrong.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Even if lolicon were illegal, why would that matter morally speaking? 
                    Most people will agree that morality shouldn’t simply be 
                    based on what is and isn’t legal according to one government or 
                    another. Possessing or selling marijuana is illegal in a majority 
                    of nations, does this make it immoral or unethical to do? If an 
                    authoritarian government decides to make protesting its actions 
                    illegal, is it wrong to oppose this government? Why should we 
                    base our personal morality on what a government decides should or 
                    shouldn’t be permitted in its borders? Not to mention — 
                    which nation has moral authority over others? If one country rules 
                    lolicon is legal and not CSEM and the other rules that it’s illegal 
                    and is CSEM, which is right?</p>
                <p>Most people will agree that the law should reflect their 
                    personal morality, not the other way around, 
                    but anti-loli crusaders will still use the claim that lolicon is 
                    illegal in one country or another as a reason for it being wrong or 
                    equivalent to pedophilia, a mentality which reflects an underlying 
                    authoritarian mindset. It is also a conflation of what currently is 
                    and what ought to be — presuming that the law as it stands is some 
                    sort of objective moral code by virtue of it being the law. 
                    “Lolicon should be illegal because it is illegal”.</p>
                <p>
                    But let’s give this insane argument the benefit of the doubt and presume that lolicon is immoral and equivalent to pedophilia if it’s illegal, and by extension, that any other type of pornography or sexual activity the government outlaws is also immoral. Is it?
                </p>
                <p>It turns out that this claim is not even correct most of the time. 
                    Most nations either do not have any laws that pertain to lolicon or any other form of fiction whatsoever, have vague laws which could be applied to it but do not explicitly outlaw it, or have laws which seem like they could apply to it but have been dismissed in court when used or never used against it. A number nations — North and South Korea, India, Cuba, China, most of the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia, as well as a lot of Eastern Europe — outlaw all porn entirely, so they are irrelevant to this discussion.</p>
                <p>Only three countries, all part of the British Commonwealth, have 
                    meaningfully implemented laws against lolicon and other specific 
                    varieties of fetish porn — Canada, the UK, and Australia. 
                    All three of these countries criminalize numerous other varieties of 
                    porn and consensual sex acts in addition to lolicon. 
                    None of these countries actively attempt to arrest people for 
                    creating, purchasing, or downloading lolicon content,
                     block imports of lolicon media, or shut down websites hosting 
                     lolicon like they do for actual CSEM.</p>
                <p>In Canada, the laws pertaining to CSEM simply happen to include fictional characters with childlike appearances, as opposed to a specific law implemented deliberately against it. Enforcement of this law is rare and almost all cases have involved individuals crossing the border with physical copies of lolicon manga. Border guards in Canada have also arrested people for possession of non-lolicon hentai manga, gay porn of adults with a “twink” body type, and most infamously, furry porn, an incident broadcast on National Geographic’s “Border Patrol” TV series (GOING TO NEED TO FIND THE CLIP, YOUTUBE UPLOAD WAS COPYRIGHT CLAIMED). More importantly, however, Canada criminalizes BDSM, as it is legally impossible to consent to BDSM activity in Canada. There are no explicit laws against BDSM porn, but taking part in it is illegal.</p>
            
                 <p>In Australia, specific legislation outlawing lolicon was introduced in the 2000s. The legislation has been almost never enforced since then. The Australian government is infamously censorship-happy, infamous for preventing violent films and video games from seeing official release in the country. The legislation targeting lolicon in the 2000s also criminalized porn created by real adults who “appear to be children” — attacking both ABDL and DD-LG fetish porn featuring childlike outfits and simply porn of adult women with small bodies and flat chests. This absurd law was routinely mocked and criticized around the world.</p>

                <p>In the UK, lolicon was outlawed under a 2009 law targeting what was infamously labeled “extreme pornography”. The definition of “extreme pornography” not only outlaws porn containing pretty much any form of BDSM (including bondage, choking, spanking, caning, whipping, penetration by a “violent object”, humiliation, and verbal degradation) but also anal fisting, ABDL and DD-LG fetish porn, urination, female ejaculation (which is considered to be urination despite scientific evidence to the contrary), and face-sitting. Face-sitting, fisting, and choking were all absurdly labeled as “potentially life-threatening”, even if done safely and with consent, and the law was routinely mocked online and in the media. The ban on lolicon was only ever enforced once, in 2015, and the one man arrested for it was let go (CITATION FOR THIS IS ON WIKIPEDIA)</p>

                <p>Even earlier than that, laws were implemented in 2003 which outlawed BDSM porn, rape-fantasy porn, vore fetish content, and any porn involving injuries or blood. These have never been enforced to my knowledge, while the “extreme pornography” laws have. Like in Canada, BDSM is illegal in the UK, under the same logic of individuals not being able to legally consent to physical harm. Thankfully, a court ruled in early 2019 that practicing consensual BDSM was legally permissible — it is likely this will lead to the laws in the UK being improved in the future.</p>

                <p>There are a number of continental European countries where CSEM laws seem to pertain to lolicon and are frequently cited by anti-loli crusaders. However, none of these laws are actually meaningful bans on the content. Almost none of them have really held up in court against it, and again, no countries actively pursue people for owning or creating it, unlike actual CSEM.</p>

                <p>In France, drawn porn depicting “minors” is illegal, but the definition of a “minor” in French law only refers to a real person, with legislators explicitly confirming that depictions of fictional characters are not illegal. In Sweden, vague legislation led to a single arrest over lolicon, but the Swedish Supreme Court ended up ruling that only photorealistic art which looks exactly like a real child — which lolicon is not — is legally considered CSEM. Italy’s laws only pertain to digitally edited photographs of real children. Poland has similar laws to Sweden, and has actually attempted to legally remove paintings from fine art galleries for depicting nude children in a photorealistic manner — despite this, fetish porn has never been targeted. In the Netherlands, vague legislation was introduced recently (as of writing this in 2019) which could pertain to lolicon, but past legislation has only ever pertained to, again, photorealistic art resembling real people, and in 2010, a court ruled that anime-style content was explicitly legal. Norway has actually successfully used anti-CSEM laws to convict someone for lolicon on a single occasion, but lolicon is not explicitly illegal and the arrest was a result of vague legislation. This is concerning, but is comparable to cases in the US where people have been arrested for incest porn (more on that in a bit). Finland, like France, explicitly protects fiction in its CSEM laws.</p>

                <p>None of these countries actively target lolicon artists or fans, try and shut down sites hosting it, or prevent imports of lolicon media. It is also worth mentioning that none of these countries legislate based on in-universe character age — all are based on the childlike appearance of the characters.</p>

                <p>But now to address the elephant in the room — the USA. Most anti-lolicon activity online is in the Anglosphere, and as the US is the largest primarily English-speaking country, nearly all discussion of lolicon’s legal status concerns US law.</p>

                <p>One thing that’s worth mentioning is that pornography is not explicitly legal in the US. The government still operates under anti-porn “obscenity laws” which technically forbid all pornographic content which is deemed to not have “artistic or literary merit”. However, through a long series of rulings by the Supreme Court and district courts, pornography is effectively legal in the US, and nobody has been arrested for creating or owning porn since the 70s.</p>

                <p>Legislation pertaining to lolicon did not exist until the 2003 PROTECT Act, a piece of legislation cited incessantly by anti-loli crusaders. While this law explicitly criminalized lolicon (defined, yet again, by visual appearance only, not by in-universe character age), it was only ever enforced twice. The second case, the infamous one against Christopher Handley, caused a district court to rule that the sections of the PROTECT act which criminalized fiction were unconstitutional, violating the First Amendment. In 2015, a man was arrested under PROTECT for having both lolicon and incest hentai on his computer as part of a scheme by his ex-wife. He ended up let go on the lolicon based on the ruling in the Handley case, but was actually prosecuted for incest porn using the anti-porn obscenity laws. Despite this, fictional incest porn is both widely produced and consumed in the US completely legally, including live-action porn with real actors, and cases like this are outliers using the remnants of general anti-porn laws.</p>

                <p>US law against CSEM, both on a federal and state level, requires media to depict an “identifiable, actual minor” in a manner that is photorealistic. A “minor” is defined as a real person (living or dead) who was under 18 at the time of the creation of the media, a definition which explicitly excludes fictional characters, just like France’s laws. Artistic content can only be considered CSEM if its production involves a real person — theoretically, drawn porn of a real child could be considered CSEM, but fiction cannot. Lolicon, on a federal level, is explicitly protected, and all state legislation relies on the “person” wording. Of course, you could still be brought to court for lolicon, but just like cases where people have been arrested for wearing clothing with expletives written on it or putting “truck nuts” on their vehicles, these frivolous cases will be thrown out of court based on this legislation.</p>

                <p>When the United Nations encouraged governments to criminalize fiction in 2019, the US government explicitly told the UN that this request was not welcome and fiction is protected under the Constitution.</p>

            <div class="sectiontitle">SECTION 3: SECONDARY ARGUMENTS AGAINST LOLI/SHOTA</div>
            <div class="sectionbody">
                <p id="toc_1">“Loli is wrong because it can be used to groom children/leads to the grooming of children”:</p>

                <p>This is one of the most common arguments which anti-loli crusaders fall back on, typically to fear-monger about a supposed danger if lolicon is not censored and its creators and fans demonized as pedophiles. It is also one of the most absurd and easiest to refute.</p>

                <p>This argument blames drawings for the actions of sexual predators. While lolicon has been used by child molesters to hurt kids, the majority of child molesters do not use lolicon, instead utilizing dolls, porn of adults, and if they have it, actual CSEM to convince children that sex with adults is acceptable. None of these people encourage outlawing, demonizing, or cracking down on dolls or live-action porn because predators use it, and taking away lolicon will not actually prevent predators from grooming children. Hell, predators use candy and toys in general to lure children even more than they use pornographic material to groom them — should we outlaw or ban candy and toys because they are used in this way? Why is the art to blame for the actions of the predator?</p>

                <p>A common counterargument to this is that it’s similar to the common argument against gun control — that criminals will kill people with other means. This argument is considered false by those in favor of gun control because while criminals will use other weapons, guns are more effective than those weapons, and thus controlling or outlawing gun ownership will reduce the damage that can be done by violent criminals. Now, regardless of how you feel about gun control or the validity of this anti-gun control argument, they are not even remotely equivalent situations. A gun is a weapon designed for the purpose of killing and injuring living things. This is its primary (if not sole) reason to exist. On the other hand, lolicon and all other forms of pornography exist exclusively so that they can be enjoyed by adults. Harming children is not even remotely what pornography is meant for, while a gun is meant to hurt and kill.</p>

                <p id="toc_2">“Loli normalizes pedophilia and will cause people to think pedophilia and molesting children are okay, or turn them into pedophiles themselves”:</p>

                <p>One must always keep in mind Carl Sagan’s aphorism that “extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. This claim, that art and sexual fantasies can somehow make people believe pedophilia is morally acceptable, or even more absurdly, turn someone who is not a pedophile into one, is always made with zero actual evidence. You’ll almost never see hard evidence such as psychology or sexology research on the topic cited by these people, the claim is simply asserted as if it requires no evidence at all. A claim of this magnitude requires</p>

                <p>The lack of evidence is partly due to there being very little research on this topic to begin with. However, one of the few studies on the topc, performed in the Czech Republic in 2012, found that neither hentai of unrealistic loli characters nor realistic art depicting children having sex had any impact on pedophilic tendencies or the desire of people who are pedophiles to abuse children.</p>

                <p>The elephant in the room on this claim, of course, is the fact that most people who insist make this claim only apply it to loli. They don’t believe incest porn makes people desire to have sex with their actual family members</p>

                <p>why does this not apply to violence in fiction? why does this not apply to incest porn vs real incest? BDSM vs abuse? bring up game of thrones and other popular series</p>

                <p>go over the various arguments in favor of “fiction affects reality!” bs (there’s multiple twitter threads debunking them in my existing logs)</p>

                <p>real vs fake “normalization”: https://twitter.com/kraygaIo/status/1202304322131808256</p>

                <p>if you do apply consistently congrats you’re consistent but still dumb (as there is no evidence)</p>

                <p>It is worth noting that a lot of these claims seem to be rooted in the idea of “porn escalation” and other anti-porn talking points promoted by fringe figures in sexology and, more importantly, by religious fundamentalists in groups like Your Brain on Porn (a site which I’ve seen unironically cited by otherwise irreligious and left-leaning anti-loli crusaders as evidence for their claims before). These groups’ claims are rejected by nearly all mainstream psychologists and sexologists.</p>

                <p>only such study on this and found no causal link, Czech study: HTTP://cphpost.dk/news/national/report-cartoon-paedophilia-harmless.html</p>

                <p id="toc_3">“Loli is pedophilia because the name comes from Lolita”:</p>

                <p>While yes comes from lolita novel, The meaning of the term has greatly distorted in Japan. lolita fashion is called that for the exact same reason lolicon is. turn took on distorted meaning of “idealized cuteness“. Shojo manga creators called their sfw cute manga lolicon back in the 80s, At one point all hentai called loli even if the characters did not have any child like traits</p>

                <p>again invoke “sadist”</p>

                <p>this is liek saying furry = bestiality because “furry” comes from animal fur</p>

                <p id="toc_4">“Loli is wrong because it’s disgusting, ew, icky, gross, yikes”:</p>

                <p>This is easily the stupidest and easiest to refute of all of the secondary arguments, as, well, it’s not even an argument. It’s just completely subjective personal disgust. If a type of fetish porn is wrong because a lot of people find it “disgusting”, then scat and urination, vore, some extreme BDSM, are all morally reprehensible and should be illegal, even if fictional or consensual.</p>

                <p>Morality should be based on harm, not disgust — should we outlaw certain types of art or architecture just because a lot of people think they look ugly or gross? Actual child sexual abuse is wrong because it does harm to a child, not because it’s subjectively “gross”.</p>

                <p>To be perfectly honest, this “argument” is the actual core of most anti-loli crusaders’ beliefs, but addressing it is so simple that I decided to pigeonhole it here rather than addressing it as part of the section on the core belief.</p>

            <div class="sectiontitle">SECTION 4: THE CORE BELIEF — ABSTRACTION, STYLIZATION, REPRESENTATION, FANTASY, AND HYPOCRISY</div>
            <div class="sectionbody">
                <p>The primary belief is that loli/shota characters are 1 to 1 representations of real children who either closely or exactly resemble them, and thus any attraction to these characters is attraction to real children, AKA pedophilia. I refer to the other arguments as secondary arguments as they are always, at least in my experience, used to support this argument. I have never seen the secondary arguments made by people who do not also hold the primary belief.</p>

                    <p>nearly all of their memes rely on it — neckbeard caricatures and that stupid spongebob meme both presume it, tthe joke is the absurdity that someone would “deny” that lolis are kids and they are pedos because they assume this is true</p>

                    <p>their terminology relies on it — “drawn cp”, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i></p>

                    <p>they think that lolis and shotas are just “drawn kids”</p>

                    <p>disclaimer about todcon and content explicitly designed to resemble real kids and how it differs from lolicon — maybe also talk about ATF</p>

                    <p>explain abstraction</p>

                    <p>no person, child or adult resembles these characters</p>

                    <p>loli not defined by “acting like child” — these retards often rely on asserting that, some do but it is not even remotely a defining characteristic, they meme lolibaba trope but almost zero lolibabas act like kids</p>

                    <p>general anime abstraction, giant anime tits and eyes =/= attraction to real deformed people</p>

                    <p>explain how fantasy is not reality, rape and incest fetishes, fictional violence</p>

                    <p>adapt stuff from <a href="https://twitter.com/soarel325/status/1177198702307336193?s=21">this thread </a></p>

                    <p>lolicon is attraction to lolis, the fictional construct — same with shota</p>

                    <p>anti loli people actively deny that people attracted to lolis but not to real children exist, equate it with being attracted to anime boys but not real men, despite how they clearly acknowledge there arre non-zoophile furries and non-cannibal voreaphilles</p>

                    <p>which brings us to hypocrisy both on violence and on other kinks</p>

                    <p>violence not “false equivalence” — how the fuck is it any different? if you say because it’s not like real violence CONGRATS THATS FUCKING ABSTRACTION AKA MY ENTIRE POINT</p>

                    <p>“violence in fiction isn’t glorified” HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA give examples of games that glorify realistic violence, slasher movies, etc</p>

                    <p>retarded fucking “narrative” argument used by that one bitch on twitter</p>

                    <p> <a href="https://twitter.com/soarel325/status/1189189681465806854">this tweet</a></p>

                    <p>The areas of your brain that video game violence activates are the same areas activated by real violence. It has the same appeal, but doesn’t say anything about a desire to commit real violence. You can’t use the excuse of enjoying game violence somehow being different.</p>

                    <p>furry — animal traits</p>

                    <p>furry = people not attracted to animals, but who are attracted to unrealistic characters with animal-like features</p>

                    <p>loli = people not attracted to children, but who are attracted to unrealistic characters with childlike features</p>

                    <p>Furry is about attraction to animal traits in an unrealistic, abstracted fantasy context, the exact same way loli is about attraction to child traits in an unrealistic, abstracted fantasy context.</p>

                    <p>if unrealistic characters with childlike traits are bad because real children can’t consent to sex, then so are unrealistic characters with animal traits as real animals can’t either</p>

                    <p>if attraction to the former is pedophilia then attraction to the latter is zoophilia</p>

                    <p>“were attracted to the human traits” so then why do they have the animal traits? furry characters are literally defined by having animal traits</p>

                    <p>guro — because anti loli gurofags exist</p>

                    <p>BDSM — abuse and rape</p>

                    <p>incest porn and incest</p>

                    <p>vore and cannibalism — vore is completely abstracted fantasy cannibalism, but that’s exactly my point. abstraction as opposed to direct representation</p>

                    <p>my little pony porn</p>

                    <p>if attraction to abstraction is the same as attraction to real thing than all of these are wrong</p>

                    <p>now move onto their attempts at defending this hypocrisy</p>

                    <p>furry is no fucking different, it is animal traits on character which does not resemble real animal, same with loli shota and child traits</p>

                    <p>“my characters can consent” NO FICTIONAL CHARACTER CAN CONSENT YOU FUCKING IMBECILE, CONSENT BASED MORALITY IRRELEVANT IN FICTION</p>

                    <p>insane “fetishes only ok if multiple people consent to them“ argument, rape role-play doesn’t make you a rapist but reading rape erotica does? (and similar comparisons)</p>

                    <p>even when loli is an in universe child being raped in a doujin — most extreme case — they don’t resemble a real child, fantasy scenario, still equivalent to “normal” rape/incest porn</p>

                <p>for those who are consistent you’re still retarded but at least you’re not a hypocrite</p>

                    <p>Rather than realizing it is a belief that must be substantiated, they see “lolicon is pedophilia” and related arguments about character age as an immutable objective law inherent to the universe</p>

                    <p>outright refuse to look at evidence against their ideas, anti loli memes will often frame arguments made by pro loli people as inherently incorrect, will accuse opponents of “denying the obvious“ or “mental gymnastics“, they see our ideas as innately false on a fundamental level and the pro loli point unprovable by definition, and thus only worthy of mockery (like flat earth ideas)</p>

                    <p>To them the very idea that their beliefs about this kink could be wrong is an absurd proposition akin to claiming gravity does not exist.</p>

            <div class="sectiontitle">CONCLUSION: WHY DO YOU CARE?</div>
            <div class="sectionbody">
                <p>A common response to those who actively argue against anti-loli claims and openly support lolicon is “why do you care so much about this”. Often, this is framed in the sense of referring to loli as a “hill to die on”, as if it is some absurd false conclusion which arguing in favor of always ends in loss for the pro-loli side (an expression of the axiomatic belief discussed earlier). So, why do we care?</p>

                    <p>Because lives have been ruined by smear campaigns demonizing innocent people as pedophiles or potential dangers to children for enjoying fictional fantasy porn.</p>

                    <p>Because friendships and romantic relationships have been destroyed by these accusations and misconceptions, driving people into depression.</p>

                    <p>Because people have been fired from their jobs under the assumption that they are a potential danger to children or a PR disaster.</p>

                    <p>Because people have been harassed off of the internet, the most vital form of communication in today’s world, by outrage mobs mad at cartoons.</p>

                    <p>None of these innocent victims deserve this hell.</p>

                    <p>Beyond the individual level, however, anti-loli mobs demand censorship, and governments comply. Calls for loli to be outlawed, or worse, for any media sexualizing “underage” characters to be made illegal, would ban huge chunks of “high art” and non-pornographic fiction where characters under 18 are depicted as having sex or portrayed in a sexual manner. Not only would this kind of legislation outlaw lolicon media, but anything from Stephen King’s It, to the Bible, all the way to the Lolita novel itself. Implementing arbitrary standards like the Miller Test, which rely on absurd, subjective metrics like “what an average person thinks” to try and control for this will do little to prevent the mass censorship. As Neil Gaiman says, the law is a blunt instrument, not a fine tool.</p>

                    <p>Censorship of fiction is NEVER okay, no matter how much you personally dislike that fiction.</p>

                    <p>goal is to convince bystanders not mobs</p>

                    <p>The intent is not to convince the idiot, but to show how they are an idiot so that the audience do not become idiots too.</p>

                <p>“It is impossible to reason someone out of a position they did not reason themselves into”</p>

                <p>high profile people and companies support anti loli shit (refer to log of notables) — maybe move this a bit up to the bit about governments listening to censorship calls</p>
